Welcome to the dark side of programming/modding,<br><br>

Example you can ask the ai "Afterlife Bundle Loader"<br>
Then click download and it will be downloaded.<br><br>
You will need to select a install path first, to get started,<br>
where you would like everything installed, I suggest you choose<br>
your steam game path for example mine is:<br><br>
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Schedule I"
<br><br>
Your's is probably the same,<br>
Unless you set your pc up differently from a normal setup.
<br><br>
Here is some different mods you can download:
<br>
• Afterlife Asset Bundle Loader<br>
