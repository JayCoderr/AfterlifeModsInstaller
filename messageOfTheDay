Hello, Anonymous user, this is Afterlife Reloaded AI,<br>
This is a heavily modified version from:<br>
https://www.afterlifereloaded.com.<br><br>
Welcome to the dark side of programming/modding,<br><br>
This is your modding dashboard for unity games,<br><br>
Install your first Afterlife Reloaded,<br>
mod below with download mod button!<br>
this will download a default mod unless you specifiy.<br>
Example you can ask the ai "Afterlife Bundle Loader"<br>
Then click download and it will be downloaded.<br><br>
You will need to select a install path first, to get started,<br>
where you would like everything installed, I suggest you choose<br>
your steam game path for example mine is:<br><br>
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Schedule I"
<br><br>
Your's is probably the same,<br>
Unless you set your pc up differently from a normal setup.
<br><br>

• what kind of question can you ask,<br> 
- Code question's related to this application.<br>
• You can do custom mods by providing the ai<br> 
- questions as a url to a direct .zip url or .rar url<br>
If you do it the dropbox way just change dl=0 to dl=1<br>
<br><br>
